1. Installing React using Create React App (CRA)

    Note: CRA is older and slower for large projects, but still works fine for 
    beginners.

Steps

    Make sure Node.js is installed

node -v
npm -v

If not installed, download from nodejs.org.

Create the React App

npx create-react-app my-app

    npx runs the package without installing globally.

    my-app is your project folder name.

Go inside the project

cd my-app

Start the development server

    npm start

    This opens the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

2. Installing React using Vite (Faster, modern, preferred for new projects)
Steps

    Create the project

npm create vite@latest my-app

You’ll get prompts:

    Project name → press Enter to use my-app

    Framework → choose React

    Variant → choose JavaScript or TypeScript

Go inside the project

cd my-app

Install dependencies

npm install

Start the development server

npm run dev

This will show a local server link like:

    Local:   http://localhost:5173/
