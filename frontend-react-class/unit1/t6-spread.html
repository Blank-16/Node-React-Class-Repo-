Spread Operator

The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part 
of an existing array or object into another array or object.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>

<script>
const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];

document.write(numbersCombined);
</script>

</body>
</html>


The spread operator is often used in combination with destructuring.
Example

Assign the first and second items from numbers to variables and put the rest
in an array:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>

<script>
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const [one, two, ...rest] = numbers;

document.write("<p>" + one + "</p>");
document.write("<p>" + two + "</p>");
document.write("<p>" + rest + "</p>");
</script>

</body>
</html>


We can use the spread operator with objects too:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>

<script>
const myVehicle = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  color: 'red'
}

const updateMyVehicle = {
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'yellow'
}

const myUpdatedVehicle = {...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle}

//Check the result object in the console:
console.log(myUpdatedVehicle);
</script>

<p>Press F12 and see the result object in the console view.</p>

</body>
</html>
