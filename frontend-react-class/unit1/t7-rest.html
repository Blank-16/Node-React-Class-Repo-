What is the Rest Operator?

    Written as ...

    Collects all remaining arguments or elements into a single array.

    Often used in functions (to gather arguments) or destructuring
     (to gather remaining properties).

1. Rest in Functions (Gather Arguments)

function sum(...numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3));      // 6
console.log(sum(4, 5, 6, 7));   // 22

Explanation:

    ...numbers collects all arguments into an array.

    You can then loop or reduce over it.

2. Rest with Array Destructuring

const colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"];

const [first, second, ...others] = colors;

console.log(first);  // red
console.log(second); // green
console.log(others); // ["blue", "yellow"]

Explanation:

    ...others collects all remaining elements after the first two into an array.

3. Rest with Object Destructuring

const person = { name: "Raj", age: 25, city: "Delhi", country: "India" };

const { name, ...details } = person;

console.log(name);    // Raj
console.log(details); // { age: 25, city: "Delhi", country: "India" }

Explanation:

    The rest operator gathers remaining properties into a new object.

4. Mixing Named and Rest Parameters in Functions

function introduce(firstName, lastName, ...hobbies) {
    console.log(`Name: ${firstName} ${lastName}`);
    console.log(`Hobbies: ${hobbies.join(", ")}`);
}

introduce("Raj", "Sharma", "Reading", "Coding", "Traveling");

// Output:
// Name: Raj Sharma
// Hobbies: Reading, Coding, Traveling

Explanation:

    Named parameters take the first values.

    Rest operator captures any remaining values.

✅ Key Points to Remember

    Rest = Collects multiple elements into an array or object.

    Used in function parameters and destructuring.

    Different from the spread operator (which unpacks arrays/objects).
