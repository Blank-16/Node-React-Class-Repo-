1. MPA – Multi-Page Application
Definition

    A Multi-Page Application is a traditional web app structure where each 
    page is loaded separately from the server.

    Every time the user navigates, the browser sends a request to the server,
     and the server returns a new HTML page.

How it works

    User clicks a link.

    Browser sends HTTP request to server.

    Server sends a full HTML document back.

    Page reloads completely.

Example (Simple MPA flow)

index.html → about.html → contact.html

Each page is separate and has its own HTML file.

Advantages

    SEO-friendly by default (each page has its own HTML).

    Simpler for small, content-heavy websites.

    Easy to implement with plain HTML, CSS, JS, or server-side frameworks like
    PHP, Django, Laravel.

Disadvantages

    Full page reloads = slower navigation.

    More repeated code between pages.

    Harder to create dynamic, app-like experiences.

2. React Framework (SPA by nature)
Definition

    React is a JavaScript library (not a full framework) for building Single-Page
    Applications (SPAs).

    Instead of loading full pages from the server, React renders content 
    dynamically in the browser.

    Uses JavaScript + Virtual DOM to update only the parts of the page that
    change.

How it works

    Browser loads one main HTML file (index.html).

    React takes over and dynamically renders components inside it.

    Navigation changes the URL but does not reload the entire page — only
    updates what’s needed.

Example (Simple React SPA flow)

index.html → React Router changes view to "About" → No full reload

Advantages

    Faster navigation (no full reloads).

    App-like user experience.

    Modular, reusable UI components.

    Easy to manage dynamic data.

Disadvantages

    SEO requires extra setup (e.g., SSR with Next.js).

    Larger initial load time (JavaScript bundle).

    Needs a build process (Webpack, Vite, etc.).
