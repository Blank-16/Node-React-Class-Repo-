<!--
  ReactJS is a component-based JavaScript library used to build dynamic and
  interactive user interfaces.
  
  It simplifies the creation of single-page applications 
  (SPAs) with a focus on performance and maintainability.

    It is developed and maintained by Facebook.
    The latest version of React is React 19.
    Uses a virtual DOM for faster updates.
    Supports a declarative approach to designing UI components.
    Ensures better application control with one-way data binding. -->

"Hello, World!" Program in React

import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

 <!-- How does React work?

React operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than directly manipulating the browser’s DOM. 
It performs necessary manipulations within this virtual representation 
before applying changes to the actual browser DOM.


Here’s how the process works:

1. Actual DOM and Virtual DOM

    Initially, there is an Actual DOM(Real DOM) containing a div with two
     child elements: h1 and h2.
    React maintains a previous Virtual DOM to track the UI 
    state before any updates.

2. Detecting Changes

    When a change occurs (e.g., adding a new h3 element), React generates 
    a New Virtual DOM.
    React compares the previous Virtual DOM with the New Virtual DOM
    using a process called reconciliation.

3. Efficient DOM Update

    React identifies the differences (in this case, the new h3 element).
    Instead of updating the entire DOM, React updates only the changed part
     in the New Actual DOM,
    making the update process more efficient. -->

<!-- Key Features of React

React is one of the most demanding JavaScript libraries because it is 
equipped with a ton of features which makes it faster and production-ready. 


Below are the few features of React.

1. Virtual DOM

React uses a Virtual DOM to optimize UI rendering. Instead of updating 
the entire real DOM directly,

React:

    Creates a lightweight copy of the DOM (Virtual DOM).
    Compares it with the previous version to detect changes (diffing).
    Updates only the changed parts in the actual DOM (reconciliation),
    improving performance.

2. Component-Based Architecture

React follows a component-based approach, where the UI is broken down 
into reusable components. 

These components:

    Can be functional or class-based.
    It allows code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

3. JSX (JavaScript XML)

React usesJSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML
inside JavaScript.

JSX makes the code:

    More readable and expressive.
    Easier to understand and debug.

4. One-Way Data Binding

React uses one-way data binding, meaning data flows in a single direction
 from parent components to child  components via props. 
 
This provides better control over data and helps maintain 
predictable behavior.

5. State Management

React manages component state efficiently using the useState hook 
(for functional components) or this.
state (for class components). 
State allows dynamic updates without reloading the page.

6. React Hooks

Hooks allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features
without needing class components.

Common hooks include:

    useState: for managing local state.
    useEffect: for handling side effects like API calls.
    useContext: for global state management.

7. React Router

React provides React Router for managing navigation in single-page 
applications (SPAs).
 
It enables dynamic routing without requiring full-page reloads. -->

<!-- 
 React is a powerful JavaScript library for building fast, scalable 
 front-end applications. 
 Created by Facebook, 
it's known for its component-based structure, single-page applications (SPAs), 
and virtual DOM,enabling efficient 
UI updates and a seamless user experience. 


Why Learn React?

Before React, front-end development struggled with:

    Manual DOM Manipulation: Traditional JavaScript directly modified the DOM,
     slowing down the performance.
    Complex State Management: Maintaining UI state became messy and hard to debug.
    Tight Coupling in Frameworks: Frameworks like Angular introduced complex
     two-way data binding that made code harder to manage.

Core Features

    Virtual DOM: React updates only the changed parts of the DOM, resulting
     in faster rendering.
    
     One-Way Data Binding: Ensures predictable and easy to debug data flow.
    
     Component-Based Architecture: Breaks UI into reusable pieces, 
     improving the code reusability and scalability.

After installing React, let's write your first React program. 
Here's a simple code example:


import React from 'react';

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;


In this example:

    import React from 'react': Imports the React library to use React 
    features in the component.
    
    function App() { ... }:
    Defines a React functional component called App.
    
    return ( ... ): The return statement renders HTML-like code (JSX) 
    inside the component.
    
    <div><h1>Hello World</h1></div>: 
    Displays a div element containing a heading (h1) with the text "Hello World."
    
    export default App: Exports the App component so it can be used in other files.
