package.json


Most important file in a React project

It contains:

    Project name, version, and metadata
    Build commands and scripts
    Dependencies and devDependencies


Difference Between Dependencies and DevDependencies


Dependencies

Required for running the project (e.g., React, ReactDOM)


DevDependencies

Required only during development (e.g., ESLint, Vite, Babel)


    These packages are downloaded and stored inside the node_modules folder.


package-lock.json


    It stores the exact version of each installed dependency.
    Contains a nested structure of dependencies.
    Helps ensure consistent installs across different machines.


README.md


    A documentation file about your project.
    Commonly includes:
    Project purpose
    How to install and run
    Author info, etc.


vite.config.js


    Contains configuration settings for Vite (the build tool).
    Used to set aliases, plugins, ports, etc.


eslint.config.js

    Contains ESLint rules (JavaScript code standards)
    Helps with code quality and linting


.gitignore

    Lists files and folders that should not be pushed to Git (e.g., node_modules, .env, dist, etc.)



Project Files Overview


index.html

Browser's entry point (root <div> is here)


main.jsx	

React/JS entry point; renders the <App /> component


App.jsx

Main React component


App.css, index.css

Styling files for components and global styles


Best Practices

    Create React components inside the src/components folder
    If something is meant for public access (like images, favicon, etc.), use the public folder.
    For assets used internally (like logos, icons, CSS files), use an assets folder inside src.


node_modules

    Contains all installed libraries and packages
    Automatically created when you run npm install or yarn install


Why Should You Not Push node_modules to Git?

    It is very large in size
    Other developers can simply run npm install to recreate it from package.json
