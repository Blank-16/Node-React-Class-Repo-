What is a Component?

In React, a component is a small, reusable part of the UI (User Interface).

Think of a component as a building block of your app.


Example:

If your project is a car, its components would be:

Tyres

Engine

Doors

Gearbox


Similarly, in a React project:

The header, button, footer, or form field can be components.


Nested Components

A component can contain other smaller components inside it.

For example: A Form component may include an Input component and a 
Button component


Role of Components in React

    Every part of the UI in React is made using components.
    Components can be reused throughout the app.
    They make the code modular, readable, and easy to maintain.


Rules for Writing Components

    Always start component names with a Capital Letter.
    Components must return a single parent tag.
    Use <div>...</div> or <>...</> (React Fragment).


You can use a component like an HTML tag:
<Fruit />
<Color></Color>


How to Write Your First React Component

In App.jsx:
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>First Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
}


Add more components in the same file:
function Fruit() {
  return <h1>Apple</h1>;
}

function Color() {
  return <h1>Red Color</h1>;
}

How to Use a Component
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>First Component</h1>
      <Fruit />        {/* Self-closing tag */}
      <Color></Color>  {/* Normal tag */}
    </div>
  );
}


Note

    A React component must return a single tag.

    You cannot return two or more HTML elements side by side
    without wrapping them.


return (
  <div>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Description</p>
  </div>
);


Component vs Normal Function

    Normal Function
    Can start with lowercase
    Executes JavaScript logic
    Called like myFunction()
    Any data type


React Component

    Must start with a Capital Letter
    Returns JSX (UI)
    Used like <MyComponent />
    Returns JSX (HTML-like)
